Generative Data Transformation Platform
---------------------------------------

A platform that enables users to design data transformation workflows using generative models. The core of the platform is a visual, block-based system where users connect processing steps. It is coupled with a YAML, TOML, or JSON representation. Each block is configured with a prompt, guiding an underlying generative model in data processing. Beyond generative blocks, the platform includes standard data processing blocks for tasks like filtering, aggregation, and data type conversion. To support large-scale data, a scripting language is integrated for complex manipulations.

Standard Nodes
--------------

* Input: A node for user input that accepts text, files, etc., primarily for testing purposes.

* API Call: Executes API requests.

* Generative: Performs data transformation using a generative model (based on the API Call node).
    ** Uses MCP for various side-effects.

* Scripting: Executes custom scripts for complex data manipulation. Code assistant models are directly integrated into the framework to aid in the implementation of various algorithms.

* Choice: A scripting, generative, or API call node that has several different outputs (e.g., a Yes/No node).

* Queue: Sends and receives data to/from a queue service (maybe based on the API Call node).

* Storage: Stores and retrieves data from a database or key-value store (using Set and Get operations).

* Plus: Concatenates data streams.

* Pod: One or more nodes can be grouped into a pod, which serves as an atomic unit for scaling. These pods can be connected to an external API to enable automated handling and management.

Implementation Notes
--------------------

* The prototype is implemented as a TypeScript web application to facilitate initial development. The production platform will have to support a scripting language, e.g., Python natively, and handle high-volume data transfer between nodes.

* UI Framework Choice: React Flow is a library for building node-based user interfaces, which provides a visual and interactive way for users to design their data transformation workflows. It supports a sufficient variety of node types, including grouping nodes for implementing a Pod.

* Specific APIs for Standard Nodes: API Call nodes, and by extension Generative, Queue, and Storage, are configured to handle various API interface protocols, starting with REST in the prototype.

* Data Types: Generative models typically work with textual data, including formats like JSON and CSV. Within the platform, nodes process TypeScript objects, with specific data handling determined by the individual node and model.

    * The production version will require a revision of its data handling and types.

* Error Handling: A separate network of error-handling connections, similar to the regular data processing connections. It is typically hidden but could be made visible to the operator upon request.

Security
--------

To ensure the platform's security, several measures are considered:

* Authentication and Authorization and role-based access control.

* Data Encryption: While data encryption beyond HTTPS is not feasible in the prototype, the production framework will address this by handling processed data in a way that it is inaccessible to the operators, or by implementing anonymization or censorship as needed.

* Input Validation for all nodes (research needed), especially those that handle user-provided data or prompts, to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.

* API Security

    * The prototype does not persist any secrets, tokens, and credentials online. However, it is under consideration whether local storage may be used for temporary storage.

    * The production platform will require a more robust solution, such as a dedicated secrets management system.

Monitoring and Observability
----------------------------

* Every edge has a unique ID, used to mark data items as they move along.

* Nodes can trigger transient or terminal error states.

* The list of data items and nodes involved in producing an error state is stored for examination.

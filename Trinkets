A compilation of small to medium-sized ideas for projects suitable for learning, training, and personal entertainment.

* Web-based EPUB reader
* Text-only web browser
* Console (with optional GUI) RSS feed reader
* A programming language without keywords
* Simple, but usable console-based code editor: syntax highlighting, code navigation, auto-completion. Modular design.
* P2P document sharing and collaboration tool
* Vertical Gantt chart. Vertical lanes represent horizontal scaling capacity (workload capacity). The chart is segmented vertically into production cycles (sprints, project phases, etc.).
* A framework for building WebGL2 playgrounds. An UI for WebGL!
* Epidemic simulation: random walkers with a chance to spread infection, a latency phase with no symptoms, and post-latency aversion, where walkers avoid visibly sick individuals.

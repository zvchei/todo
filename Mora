Just barely accepted my mortality,
Await for death, erasing flesh and mind.
I turned my days into formality,
And left my plans and dreams behind.
And there you are, as I prepare for my sleep.
With nature dark and bittersweet,
You took my rest, my slumber deep.
And held me tight, and incomplete.
Don't dare make me love again!
Don't dare bring me back to life.
All is dust. No thing to gain.
Your kiss - too hot, and sharp as knife.

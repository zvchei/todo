= LLM-powered Code Change Analyser

1. File Change Detection
Identifies and lists all modified files in a pull request (PR) or compares a given branch against the main branch. For 
each file, a separate diff is generated, highlighting the specific changes.

2. Automated Issue Detection and Suggestions
Runs a language model (LLM) on each code diff to detect potential issues and recommend improvements. The model should 
provide machine-readable outputs that precisely indicate where suggestions should be applied within the diff.

3. Annotated Diff Visualization
Displays a highlighted, annotated version of the diff, with suggestions and issue flags clearly marked, for easy 
understanding and action.

4. Optional Enhancements
Provides additional features for improved workflow, such as:
  * Buttons to automatically generate patches that apply the model’s suggestions.
  * Options to create tasks or issues based on the model’s recommendations for further action.
  * Other customizable features to streamline code review and integration.

= The Library
Concept

== Introduction

"The Library" is a toolkit designed to aid individuals with extensive data collections (data hoarders) in arranging and managing their collections. The fundamental class of components of this system is the Document, representing various forms of data such as text, image, or recording. A special type of Document is the Archives which serves as a repository for metadata and spatial information regarding to all of the documents in the Library.

Each distinct physical site accommodates a database housing the Archive specific to that location, along with the documents that can be accommodated within the confines of the database. Any documents that exceed the capacity of the database are systematically organized within the local file system. To ensure data integrity, multiple physical locations are required to maintain redundant copies of the archived data. Periodic synchronization of Archives between different locations is possible when a network connection is established. These synchronized Archives retain comprehensive data regarding the documents, including history, copy count, locations, and identifying attributes.

A fundamental principle upheld by the Library is the preservation of data integrity, emphasizing the prevention of data loss. As a result, the removal of any Document requires a proof of redundancy. The extent to which this rule is implemented can be accommodated to suit various user preferences. However, regardless of the case, the Library ensures that data deletion cannot result from inadvertent actions or momentary lapses in judgment.

Similarly, as modifications are applied to a Document's content, the Archive module creates and maintains a historical record of changes over time, utilizing techniques like deltas and other space-efficient strategies. The historical record has all the information required to restore the content of the Document at any point in time, unless the user explicitly chooses to make a version of the Document unrecoverable. Furthermore, even in instances where changes are discarded, the corresponding Archive governing the Document will retain timestamps and hashes of prior versions for future reference.

It's important to note that automatic propagation of deletions and  to other Archives will not occur; user initiation is essential for such action.

Another important class within this system is the Tag, which essentially functions as a document that describes another document. Tags are typically preserved within the database. They play a crucial role in facilitating the search and organization of the document collection.

== The User Interface
The User Interface is designed to cater to individual user preferences. It is highly modular and offers the flexibility to switch between different "workspaces" tailored to specific users and tasks. Here is a list of some of the toolsets and their respective purposes:

=== The Memory Explorer
The Memory Explorer encompasses a set of functions designed to create an archive of the user's memories. It employs various strategies to enhance the user's ability to recall and recover memories, extract associations, impressions, and dreams.

==== Notable features:
* The "Word of the Day" module selects a random (or suggested) word to help the user focus on retrieving memories by free association.
* It includes an LLM and text-to-speech processor to create guided meditation and guided active imagination sessions for memory exploration.
* An NLP algorithm identifies focus words and themes from the user's described memories and supports the other modules.

=== The Document Organizer
The Document Organizer assists users in organizing and preserving their file collections. It offers the ability to preview files, suggests appropriate Tags by analyzing their contents, and ensures that important information is readily available to the user. This includes reminders about storage maintenance and warnings about documents at risk of loss of data.

=== The Photo Organizer
Functioning similarly to the Document Organizer, the Photo Organizer specializes in managing visual documents, such as photographs. It encourages users to write captions and memos for each photograph and utilizes computer vision (CV) algorithms to assist in tagging images by extracting themes, items, people, and other relevant information from them.

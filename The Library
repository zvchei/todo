"The Library" is a toolkit designed to aid individuals with extensive data collections (data hoarders) in arranging and managing their collections. The fundamental class of components of this system is the Document, representing various forms of data such as text, image, or recording. A special type of Document is the Archives which serves as a repository for metadata and spatial information regarding to all of the documents in the Library.

Each distinct physical site accommodates a database housing the Archive specific to that location, along with the documents that can be accommodated within the confines of the database. Any documents that exceed the capacity of the database are systematically organized within the local file system. To ensure data integrity, multiple physical locations are required to maintain redundant copies of the archived data. Periodic synchronization of Archives between different locations is possible when a network connection is established. These synchronized Archives retain comprehensive data regarding the documents, including history, copy count, locations, and identifying attributes.

A fundamental principle upheld by the Library is the preservation of data integrity, emphasizing the prevention of data loss. As a result, the removal of any Document requires a proof of redundancy. The extent to which this rule is implemented can be accommodated to suit various user preferences. However, regardless of the case, the Library ensures that data deletion cannot result from inadvertent actions or momentary lapses in judgment. 

Similarly, as modifications are applied to a Document's content, the Archive module creates and maintains a historical record of changes over time, utilizing techniques like deltas and other space-efficient strategies. The historical record has all the information required to restore the content of the Document at any point in time, unless the user explicitly chooses to make a version of the Document unrecoverable. Furthermore, even in instances where changes are discarded, the corresponding Archive governing the Document will retain timestamps and hashes of prior versions for future reference.

It's important to note that automatic propagation of deletions and  to other Archives will not occur; user initiation is essential for such action.

# Copilot Instructions for ToDo Repository

## Repository Overview

This is a **research and ideation documentation repository** focused on AI agent design, LLM experiments, and game theory concepts. All content is in Markdown format, organized as individual concept documents. The repository uses Obsidian for local note management and is committed to GitHub for version control.

**Repository Type**: Documentation + Research Notes  
**License**: CC0 1.0 Universal (public domain)  
**Primary Use**: Capturing, developing, and iterating on AI/LLM project ideas

## Key Conventions

### Document Structure
- **File naming**: Each concept or project gets its own `.md` file with a descriptive title (e.g., `Self-modifying agent`, `Wargame.md`)
- **No .md extension on some files**: Some older documents may not have `.md` extension but should be treated as Markdown
- **Content pattern**: Documents typically follow an exploration structure:
  1. **Core concept** - What the idea is about
  2. **Design details** - Key mechanics, architecture, or approach
  3. **Tasks/ideas section** - Actionable next steps and investigations

### Content Types Found in Repository

The repository covers several thematic areas (not exhaustive):

- **AI Agent Design**: Self-modifying agents, NPC systems, autonomous workflow orchestration
- **LLM Experiments**: Steering experiments, overfitting exploration, prompt analysis
- **Game Design**: Text-based games, wargames, AI agent game environments
- **Data/Knowledge Systems**: Knowledge graphs, generative data transformation, page summarization
- **Research Documentation**: Side-quests and observations (e.g., "Malik Petersen" investigation into LLM name association)

### Editing Guidelines

- **Preserve existing structure**: When adding to documents, maintain the existing section hierarchy and style
- **Include task lists**: Use "Tasks and ideas" section with bullet points for next steps
- **Reference patterns**: When cross-referencing other concepts, note the relationship in context
- **Commit messages**: Be descriptive (e.g., "Add initial content for X", "Summarize Y technique", "Fix typo in Z")
- **Research documentation**: When exploring emergent LLM behaviors or phenomena, document both findings and methodology used

## No Build/Test/Lint Commands

This is a pure documentation repository with no code compilation, testing, or automated linting processes. All changes are manual content edits.

## Using Obsidian

The `.obsidian` directory contains workspace configuration. When opening this repository:
- Obsidian will recognize it as a vault automatically
- The workspace state is tracked in `.obsidian/workspace.json`
- Configuration files (plugins, appearance, core settings) are committed to version control

When committing changes, workspace state changes may appear in diffs but are expected.

## Relevant MCP Servers

No MCP servers are configured or needed for this documentation-only repository.

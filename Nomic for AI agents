== A playground for self-regulating AI agents

* Autonomous agents, powered by LLM, wage intellectual war in an imagined textual landscape.
* Agents take turns in which they attempt to augment the landcape to their benefit in order to reach a predetermined set of goals.
* An arbiter decides wether the action is valid and successful and declares the result.
* Agents will follow the rules set by the arbiter in the landscape, and they also have their own instruction (strategy, memory, etc) which they would follow.
* Agents will have the (limited?) opportunity to change their own instruction in an attempt to improve themselves.
